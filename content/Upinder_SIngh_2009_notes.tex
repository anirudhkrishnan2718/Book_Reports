\section*{Introduction : Ideas of the Early Indian Past}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Book Citation : \cite{Upinder_Singh_2009}
    \item Subcontinental India (referring to modern day India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bhutan, and Bangladesh) can be divided into major geographical regions based on the dominant river systems, mountain ranges or plateaus.
    \item Movement of goods and people between India's geographical regions and outside the subcontinent has been observed since ancient times.
    \item \Gls{prehistory} ended with the invention of the Mesopotamian Cuneiform script (3400 BCE) and Egyptian Hieroglyphics (3100 BCE), and the Harappan script (3000 BCE)
    \item Since the Harappan script has not yet been deciphered, \gls{protohistory} in the context of India refers to the period 1500 BCE - 500 CE, which has an oral literature but no direct written sources.
    \item \Gls{histriography} in India began with the Orientalist stage of early 18th and 19th century British India, with the founding of the \gls{asi} in 1871 characterized by a western-centric critique of Indian customs and traditions, an over-reliance on Brahmanical interpretations of scripture.
    \item Spurred on by the national freedom movement, nationalist historians contributed to Indian histriography by glorifying India's past as a Golden Age to be ended by the arrival of Muslim invaders.
    \item Marxist historians made the perspective shift of dividing history into periods based on class-relations and agrarian norms, instead of the prevailing political stratification.
    \item Historical narratives have suffered from textual sources being the primary driver with archaeological sources only being used as corroborating evidence.
    \item Most of the people in India's ancient past are not represented in its history because of the monopoly of the literate and elite few of the time in recording written information. Archaeological data becomes the main way to tell the stories of these forgotten populations.

\section{Understanding Literary and Archaeological Sources}

\subsection{Reading Ancient Texts from a Historical Point of View}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Unlike China, which evolved paper by the 3ed century BCE and wood-block printing by 4th century BCE, India still had a vibrant tradition of palm leaf manuscripts all the way from antiquity to the 19th century when the printing press finally superseded it.
    \item Texts have been composed over centuries of oral tradition before they were compiled, finalized and written down, which makes historical context of the physical manuscript much narrower than the work being written down.
    \item The Vedas (written in Sanskrit), which are the oldest surviving Indian text belong to the Indo-Iranian branch of the Indo-European family of languages. The other major linguistic family in India is the Dravidian family, which covers all south Indian modern day languages.
    \item In Ancient India, there was no delineation between the religious and secular teachings contained within a religion (such as \Gls{dharma} or the Buddhist \Gls{dhamma})
    \item The four Vedas (dated at about 1500 BCE - 500 BCE) are the world's oldest existing poetry which are primarily a guide to religious rituals and the philosophical interpretations of such rituals. They are religious texts, with very few references to historical events, and thus, cannot be used to infer much about the sociology or history of ancient Northern and North-western India.
    \item Mahabharata (composed over 400 BCE - 400 CE) and the Ramayana (composed over 500 BCE to 300 CE) are the two epics of ancient India. Characters, location and events from the two epics are mentioned in the other, showing that these were not isolated works.
    \item Events and characters described in the two epics have not been verified to be true. They may simply have been small scale conflicts glorified by bards and poets over the centuries.
    \item Puranas, Dharmashastras, and other Vedanga texts solidify Hindu traditions such as the stratification of society, the rights of women, and other prescriptive actions to be undertaken in the quest for \Gls{moksha}. Contradictions and divergent commentaries within the Vedangas are a result of the many centuries over which these works were composed.
    \item Buddhist, Jain, early Tamil (Sangam), Kaanada and Tulu literature provides many religious, philosophical, scientific, technical and daramatic works to draw historical information from. These works, however, need to be interpreted carefully because of the nature of the patrn-artist relationship under which most of them were produced.
    \item Accounts of foreign travelers from China (Fa Hien and Hiuen Tsang), Persia (Al-Biruni) and Greece (Megasthenes) are a valuable window into the life and times of ancient and early medieval India.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Archaeology and the Early Indian Past}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Material evidence found at a site often depends on the forces of nature that may or may not have destroyed part of it (usually the organic artefacts), the movement of human settlements the centuries as a result of natural disasters, and their \gls{stratigraphy} within the archaeological site.
    \item In India, underwater archaeology deals with entire cities that have been submerged over the centuries (such sa Dwaraka, Gujarat) requiring modern advances in remote sensing, radar, and diving.
    \item Over the last 50 yars, the advent of \gls{archaeometry} (most famously Carbon-14 dating) has enabled a much less intrusive and hands-off method of analysing artefacts, especially those buried deep underground or undersea.
    \item \Gls{paleontology} and the related field of paleo-pathology, which looks at the diseases and deaths of past human societies are also enabled by advances in modern medicine.
    \item In India, more-so than the rest of the world, ancient crafts, techniques and workmanship survives, making the study of these modern day craftsmen a useful tool in piecing together the picture of unearthed ancient artefacts.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Epigraphy: The Study of Inscriptions}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \Gls{epigraphy} in India starts with the un-deciphered Harappan script, with the 400 BCE Brahmi script around the time of Ashoka being the earliest fully deciphered one.
    \item In a script, a written symbol stands for a word (logographic), a syllable (syllabic) or a sound (alphabetic). The last category requires that vowels exist fully independent of consonants.
    \item The Brahmi script developed from 300 BCE to 600 CE evolved into the Devanagari script (around 1000 CE) and proto-Bengali in eastern India (around 1200 CE).
    \item Modern Tamil script took shape around 700 CE emerging from local varieties of Brahmi, around the time of the Pallava dynasty. Other South Indian scripts evolved by 1400 CE.
    \item Scholars working for the East India Company in the 1800s deciphered the Brahmi and Kharoshti scripts painstakingly over many years, with the assistance of bi-script documents acting as Rosetta stones.
    \item Sanskrit subsumed Prakrit as the language of high culture and learning by 500 CE, along with Tamil in South India achieving the same status by 700 CE
    \item Dates on inscriptions usually were eras based on the ascension of Kings, or the start of dynasties, along with the luni-solar Hindu calendar.
    \item Most inscriptions tend to be dedication sot great men and women, memorials of martyrs and soldiers, records of land or wealth donated by kings, or simple records of the existing political, social and economic climate made by common folk.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Numismatics: The Study of Coins}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Since coins from the same time degrade in size and weight the longer they circulate, \gls{metrology} offers an immediate means of dating the sites at which they are found.
    \item The earliest \gls{coinage} in India appeared around 400 BCE, usually made of silver or copper even though barter still continued as an alternative medium of commerce.
    \item Coins of low value often used copper, lead, tin, bronze or other alloys with silver and were issued either by royal decree or by private guilds.
    \item \Glspl{legend} on coins are rarely dates or other chronological information. They are usually observed to be the names of kings, the mint towns where they were produced, or a religious inscription.
    \item \Gls{counter-struck} coins are valuable sources of information about political rivalries, conquest and succession, and the geographical spans of kingdoms in ancient and early medieval India
\end{itemize}
